## C

- **complementation assay**.
  - an assay that works by recovering functionality _only when_ all parts are present
  - an example of a complementation assay is the **yeast two-hybrid** method
    for probing protein-protein interactions
  - this is analagous to **complementation** in genetics, where the wild-type
    phenotype is recovered from two different homozygous recessive mutants
